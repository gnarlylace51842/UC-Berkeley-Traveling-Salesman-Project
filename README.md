# UC-Berkeley-Traveling-Salesman-Project
During the summer of my 10th grade, I was mentored by some students under Prof. Salahuddin at UC Berkeley regarding the famous open-ended TCS problem: The Traveling-Salesman Problem. I helped create and rediscover new methods of optimizing solutions for this problem in the span of 7-8 weeks.
