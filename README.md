# UC-Berkeley-Traveling-Salesman-Project
During the summer of my 10th grade, I was mentored by some students under Prof. Salahuddin at UC Berkeley regarding the famous open-ended TCS problem: The Traveling-Salesman Problem. I helped create and rediscover new methods of optimizing solutions for this problem in the span of 7-8 weeks. Using my knowledge of Python/Java and the creation of Algorithms, I designed/ported many variations of methods to optimize solutions in both time and accuracy.

Some of the methods I made were:
- 3-Opt method
- Brute Force method
- Group Method
- Greedy Method
- Dynamic Programming Method
- Unravel Method

All of these were analyzed using MatplotLib, graphs, etc.

To run this program:
1. Just run the program via Terminal!
